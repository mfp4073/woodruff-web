							paintings in this exhibition correspond to an ongoing series of
							installations and kineticperformances by Woodruff collectively known
							as the <strong><em>Burning Woman Project</em></strong>. Painstakingly
							crafted papier-mache
							effigies of the artist are burned in ceremonial events often coinciding
							with celestial movements such as an Equinox or a Solstice. An
							especially beautiful, unburned example is installed in the center of
							the gallery show, surrounded on all sides by painted odes to the
							forces of Nature with which she communes. She is Promethea,
							and from Escalus to Shelley, this myth has presented the hero her
							namesake as a defiant champion of mankind; an archetype in
							this case lent a modern symbolic meaning as Promethea engenders
							(no pun intended) a feminine archetype of power. In counterpoint to
							the masculine idea of fire as a tool or a destructive force, in the fem-
							inine it symbolizes transformation and rebirth. Although the sculptures
							and their conflagrations are not necessarily paint-based, and although
							the paintings are representational, the do share certain formal, conceptual and spiritual concerns with the Burnings.

							sculpture's gestalt is more overtly temporal than the enduring works on
							canvas and panel. Yet beyond red herring comparisons to O'Keeffe and Frankenthaler,
							Woodruff's paintings celebrate the defiant freedom of visual traditions
							like Tibetan sand mandalas, meticulously executed expressly to be erased
							by the elements thereby embracing impermanence and eternal flux. The paintings
							are named with a fanciful eye toward the physical sciences:<em> Properties
								of Light, Luminiferous, Transmorfification, Transcendece, Psyche's Sisters
							</em>.
							And in fact, the visual properties-the playful and optically dynamic interaction
							between blue and yellow; the organic and expressive lines weaving through
							color field washes-flirt with scientific image types as well as spiritual.
							Resuscitating ancient visual symbols in a modern political context of
							feminine revolution, Woodruff writes in her statement: &quot;The triangle,
							which dates back to the Chauvet Cave paintings, serves as a symbol for
							the feminine. The Greek Psyche, which manifests as a butterfly is rep-resentative
							of the spirit. The circle or mandala is the essence of the dreamer's search
							for unity...In the resolution of this dialectic, where personal consciousness
							and the collective unconscious merge, the art creates a ritual space for
							each observer.&quot; <br>
							<br>
							<strong><font size="3">I</font></strong>t is too bad that most reviewers,
							even those who enjoy the paintings, have reservations about discus-sing
							the fundamental spiritual underpinnings of work like this. Formally they
							are elusive and suspicious of rigid, generic descriptive terms. The artist
							contem-plates a literal and figurative swirl of inter-related ideas and
							the painting process is an exercise of those meditations. The paintings
							are never intended as fixed systems of formal elements but rather as evocative
							restatements of their artist's initial, interior gesture and the ripples
							the gesture makes as it travels outward from the center.
