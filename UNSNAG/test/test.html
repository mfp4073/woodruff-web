WECHSLER, ONE WELD 'WORD'
<br><br>
Independent producer Nick Wechsler ("North Country") has launched development of Bruce Bauman's debut novel "And the Word Was" with Volume One's Gena Resnick and Dean Levitt.
<br><br>
Story's centered on a grief-stricken emergency room physician who leaves New York for India after the death of his son in a Columbine-like massacre and searches for life's meaning amid the poverty of New Delhi.
<br><Br>
Wechsler's currently producing "Reservation Road" for Focus, with Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo starring for director Terry George in an adaptation of the John Burnham Schwartz novel. The film, which also involves the death of a son, just wrapped.
<br><Br>
Resnick and Levitt are exec producing "Reservation Road," which also stars Jennifer Connelly and Mira Sorvino.
"I didn't think I would be drawn to a similarly tragic story, but Bauman's book is so rich in detail and feeling," Wechsler said. "So we're optimistic that we'll be able to attract great talent."

"Bauman's first novel is a magnificent debut, smart and intense, but accessible and riveting. This is simply a great novel."<br>
- <i>Booklist</i>
<br><br>
Does "what only novels can: Make us gasp, sit up, say yes, the world has changed. This is what it feels like to live now."<br>
- <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i>
<br><br>
"Think Albert Camus, Marcel Proust, and Larry David engaged in a debate on the meaning of sacrifice and forgiveness."<br>
- <i>Boldtype</i>
<br><br>
"Downs and the other characters in Bauman’s New Delhi resemble those in the Jerusalem of Robert Stone’s Damascus Gate....Confidently and profoundly exploring the languages of grief, guilt, ravaged memory and lost faith, Bauman's debut novel traverses the psyche of a man whose personal diaspora and reconnection to the world quietly alter our perception of our own."<br>
- <i>L.A. Weekly</i>

<h3><b>The Word on <i>And the Word Was</i></b></h3>
<p>
<p>
<b>by Joy Nicholson, author of <i><a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0312268637-0">The Road to Esmeralda</a></i></b><br>
<br>
One of the most beautiful things in the world is finding a great book purely by chance. For instance, you happen to be in a bookstore buying a coffee table book on Egypt for your boss's birthday, when an Ed Ruscha-esque title font catches your eye. <i>And The Word Was</i>, purrs the title, by Bruce Bauman. It's right there on the new fiction rack. 
You pick it up, intrigued, annoyed by the biblical phrase. <i>And The Word Was</i> seems to be about god, godlessness, quantum physics, hope, escape, fucking, New York, India, a Columbine-style massacre. You read a few sentences--and then a few more. Uh, oh--your eye catches this gravelly sentence, spoken by a Holocaust survivor, "People like you don't want to believe that I wasn't a sweet-souled mensch before Auschwitz, or a nice boychik after." You can tell this book is not going to be like other (politically correct) literary fiction books.
<br><br>
Of course you can't afford a gift and a new hardback novel, but, well, you don't like your boss much, and besides, you are a bookaholic. You go home. You devour the novel.
<br><br>
Oh, my God. My God.<br>
<br>
At the end of the book, you cry. It's 4 a.m. You've been wrenched through the simply stated emotions of a man losing his child to a random act of malice. A man trying to find meaning in cruelty and chaos. A man trying to be alive and hopeful in a human morass, a man at war with God and modern philosophy, yet, a man who still enjoys Moghul chicken, playing tennis, getting blow jobs. By the end of the night you've seeped into the consciousness of Dr. Neil Downs, accompanying him from Brooklyn, through Dachau, to Delhi; from moral detachment, to tingling engagement; from sadness, to hindi-hipness, to hopeful atheism. 
You've met his erstwhile mentor, Levi Furstenblum, a survivor and deconstructor of the Holocaust, a man who wears his world weariness like a second skin, a compelling character who deposits cold, hard truths without even a flinch.<br>
<br>
And, yet, for all the death, for all the truth, the book isn't grim. It's all been written so lightly, so engagingly.<br>
<br>
A hopeful atheist yourself, you wonder out loud at the elegance of the writer's task. It's a triumph because this book isn't simple. It's just written as if it were. <br>
