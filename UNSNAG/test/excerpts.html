<h1>Excerpts<P></h1> 
<b><i>from </i>And the Word Was:</b>
<p>
<p>
MY NAME IS Downs. I am a Jew. Whether or
not that is essential to the story I am about to tell only you will
be able to judge. Maybe you could read through my whole tale
and never know until—kabbalah-krishna-kaboom—comes the
HollywoodBollywood car-crash denouement and my dilemma
is, at last, resolved. But I am no trickster, so it is best I tell you
in the beginning.
<p>
...
<p>
I LIVED ALONE. In New Delhi. Before moving
there, I lived my whole life, thirty-nine years, in New York
City. Please, no Second Avenue New Deli Borsht-Belt and
famed, Holy Cow bagel chip jokes. I’ve heard them all.
<p>
I did not choose Delhi because I was a Pepsi-Generation
hippie turned dyspepsia-generation yuppie, who long ago got
stoned and laid to the ragas of Ravi Shankar and yearned for
the gloried conquests of youth; no, his music bored me into
stupefaction; I did not choose Delhi because I was a midlifecrisis
New Ager with a self-indulgent belief that I’d find a drivethru
Guru who would instantly end my emptiness and infuse
me with internal peace; no, because I must’ve set a record when
I was, ever so politely, asked by the enlightened Desiree Prana
(born Rene Kerstein of Roslyn, Long Island) never to come back
to her yoga class because I disruptively murmured “shit” and
“fuck” every time I couldn’t contort my body into Gumbyesque
position; I did not choose Delhi because I craved Indian food
and hung out in the dingy restaurants on East 6th Street; nope,
because even the odor of curry upset my delicate digestive system. I did not choose Delhi because I was infatuated by the literature,
the art, or the movies; I knew almost nothing of the
Indian arts. I did not choose India because I wanted to conquer
the languages of Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, or any of the hundreds
of other languages and dialects spoken by over one billion
people; no, I wanted to be deaf to the world around me. I did
not choose Delhi because of my lustful desire to experiment
with the innumerable sexual entanglements of the Kama Sutra;
I almost never expected to have sex again after I left New York.
Nor did I choose Delhi because of my mystical belief in the
reincarnations of Hinduism.
<p>
I chose Delhi because it was so foreign and far away. Because
I knew almost no one, and no one well at all. And no one
knew me. But most of all, I chose Delhi because I no longer
believed in god.
<p>

<i>When Adolf Hitler won the Nobel Peace Prize, fifty years ago in 1946, my mother,
father, sisters, and I listened with rapture to the ceremonies on the radio and then
watched them on the weekend newsreels like everyone else who lived in Munich.
My father, who was a Munich policeman, never seemed happier as we celebrated
this bold man of peace, The Fuhrer who saved Europe from world war and solved
the problem of the Jews.</i>
<p>
—Levi Furstenblum,<br>
from his novella, <i>CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE</i>, written in 1951
<p>
...
<p>
WHEN I GOT there, Vishnu gave me the message
that Levi Furstenblum had called. He was having lunch at
precisely 2:30 at the Indian International Center on Lohdi Road.
If I wanted to meet him, I shouldn’t call back, just show up. Or
not. If I did show up, I need only tell the host to lead me to his
table.
<p>
My body sagged with exhaustion, but there was no way I
was missing this opportunity. I took a short nap before Vishnu
drove me over to the center, which is a cultural hub for the elite
of Delhi with a fine library, restaurant, and living quarters, all
of which you must be a member, or accompanied by a member,
to use.
<p>
I arrived precisely on time. Furstenblum was easing himself
into a chair at a nearly isolated corner table by a window
inside the first-floor dining room. He spotted me walking behind
the host and waved his cane.
<p>
“I thought you would come.” No happy hello from him.
Only a stark expression and eyes hidden behind tinted glasses.
“Please, sit down.”<p>

I was nervous and felt tremors in my hands as I sat down
and spoke at the same time. “I was out late and then had an
emergency and I am supposed to meet someone at a lecture at
Nehru University at 4:30, so forgive me if I seem . . .”
<p>
“Roberson’s lecture?”
<p>
“Yes. You know his work?”
<p>
“We’re kindred minds of a sort. Not in politics. I am metapolitical,”
he stated this sentiment with a challenging growl. I
didn’t question his assertion. “In his true calling he is a modern
Kabbalist, for when you are a Roberson, what is linguistics
but a searching for god in words? But his quest is futile.”
I thought I understood what he was telling me, yet wondered
if he wanted me to question him. I’d wanted this chance
but was too scared right then to take it. I continued in the same
verbal plane. “Are you going to his lecture?”
<p>
“It is on politics. I said I am meta-political.” His condescension
was palpable as he shook his head and frowned. “He called
me yesterday. Perhaps we will meet.” Delhi was getting to be
too damn small a place. “We speak via email.” It surprised me
that Furstenblum had email. But why wouldn’t he? Unlike most
of us, he probably understood how it worked. “Besides, there
will be too many people. My hearing aid is no good for groups.”
He pointed to his ears. I saw a tiny hearing aid tucked in each
ear. “Come. As good Jews, let us get serious.” He handed me
the menu. “The Moghul chicken is excellent, though I am partial
to the fish and chips.”
<p>
We ordered and then he got to the reason why he had called.
<p>
“Judah corrected my misimpression that you were here as
a tourist. You work as a doctor at the embassy, but you are not
Foreign Service or in the military?”
<p>
“No.”
<p>
“So, tell me, why are you here?”
<p>
I thought about being flip, even provocative—-feeling embarrassed
by my deep reverence for him—-but decided to just
say the truth. “I’m running away.”
<p>
“Yes, this seems like a good place for that. I cannot run and
could not run when I came, the Nazis saw to that.” He spoke
both literally and figuratively and seemed to be talking about
himself while slyly talking about me. “I could not return to
Prague for the friends I had were either not friends or dead. I
tried America. Much too prosperous and self-satisfied. And
soulless. Then I went to Israel. My friend Schneerman persuaded
me to go there. You’ve heard of the great Rebbe?” Not
reverence, but amusement lilted from his voice as he pronounced
this title of honor. “To whom I am ineluctably bound
because we survived summer camp together.”
<p>
Adolph Schneerman, born into a wealthy and assimilated
German-Jewish family of whom he alone survived Auschwitz,
immigrated to Israel, where he’d become a noted Kabbalist and
head of a renowned sect of Orthodox Jews.
<p>
“I know the headline stuff.”
<p>
“As do most. He is more complex than his reputation and
his <i>farbissener kop</i> belie. Before you judge from the headlines
you should know that every day for two years he lamented,
‘What did we do to deserve this?’ Of course there was no answer.
But when he survives, he thinks somehow he is Yahweh’s
special envoy. So he leapt into total and absolute faith of his
messiah’s eventual return. Which led him to his answer that
those in the camps deserved to die for past sins as now do the
Palestinians.” Schneerman’s proclamation made headlines in
Israel and caused tremors in religious communities around the
world. It made him a pariah in many of those communities. “He
and I will never agree on his repugnant beliefs. Never. But I
understand how he came to these beliefs.”
<p>
The waiter brought the food and we started to eat. I did not
know his custom, so I remained quiet until he got halfway
through his fish and chips, when he spoke again. His mind
keen, he picked up exactly where we left off.
<p>
“I had to leave Israel after a disheartening experience in a
bank in Tel Aviv. I was waiting on line when a Yemenite Jew
screamed at a European Jew, ‘Hitler should have gotten you all.’
I could not stay in another place with so much hate and bigotry.
I remain angry. But I am beyond hate.”
<p>
“But there is plenty of bigotry here with the caste system
and the problems between Hindus and Moslems.”
<p>
“Yes, but I found a certain quiet here. So, in a sense, I, too,
was running away.” He did not smile at his admission. “I did
not understand Hindi. Even fewer spoke English then. I found
it easy to be foreign.” I understood exactly what he meant. “And
then I met Hannah, a Jew, oddly enough—her family fled Germany
in the thirties and went to Iraq. In the fifties, they came
here. In the sixties, the rest went to Israel. Hannah stayed with
me. She died two years ago.”
<p>
He recited this matter-of-factly while drinking his beer. I
wanted to say “sorry” or something, but his presence forbade
any gratuitous offerings.
<p>
“Why do you still go to temple?” I asked.
<p>
“Because I am a Jew and whether I believe in Yahweh or
not, the Germans and the Czechs and the French all proved my
Jewishness. And,” he spoke with an uncommon, Tevya-like
zestful irony, “they need a tenth for the minyan.”
<p>
I had read his books and seen him in the temple, and this
didn’t jibe. Feeling a bit bolder I voiced my skepticism. “I don’t
know if I can accept that answer.”
<p>
He gave out a muffled, almost encouraging laugh. I felt OK
about challenging him. Then he bowed his head, slid his glasses
slightly down his nose and gazed at me above the frame. “I go
because I need to look in the eyes of those who believed as I
once believed. Because you cannot run away.”
<p>
“And in my eyes?”
<p>
He stared in my eyes but did not answer my question. “You
know that when I was a student I was a physicist?”
<p>
“Yes, you wrote a little bit about that in <i>Mystical Mistakes</i>.”
<p>
“Correct. And I thought I was much better than I was. I theorized
that I alone could reconcile the seeming irreconcilable
contradiction between Heisenberg and Einstein.”
<p>
He had written about that with great humor. He answered
Einstein’s declaration that “God does not play dice” with his
own challenge “Yahwehna make a bet?” As far as I knew
Einstein never accepted.
<p>
“I even had a name for my theorem before I had a solution:
the Furstenblum Paradox. Through the beauty of math I believed
I would find my god. Before I found the solution, came another
solution and my world was taken apart.” Because of his abilities
as a physicist, the Nazis had offered to spare the lives of his wife
and child if he had aided their weapons program. He had refused.
He believed the Nazis would kill them either way. “And I came
to a completely different conclusion about god in any form.”
<p>
I listened, awed by the almost wrath-like self-analysis without
any forgiveness for the hubris of youth or the impossibility
of his choices.
<p>
“Now, something happened to you and the question arose
that all of us face, some very simply, some very abstractly. And
the question is always, in one form or another, this: How much
must you love god to accept Auschwitz? Or whatever happened
to you? To accept that god exists after that? There is only one
answer to that question. The answer you have come to. And
then you must find another answer.”
<p>
His surety of my torment left me too intimidated to ask more
questions. He finished his food. “I am tired. My knees hurt.” I
could see the pain as he crossed and uncrossed his legs.
<p>
“There are surgeries and medications that might help you.
They are expensive but something could be arranged.”
<p>
“I have money. I made sure the Germans paid me. And my
books, though not big sellers have never been out of print in
twenty-five languages.”
<p>
His voice and words said he did not want to mend his knees,
end that pain.
<p>
He paid the bill. I knew better than to protest. I thanked him
for his generosity and I meant not only in buying me lunch. As
we walked slowly outside, he told me that he came there every
Saturday after going to Bahrisons, the bookstore at Khan Market.
“Join me anytime,” he offered.
<p>
Despite my despair, I was flattered and pleased and said I
would, and offered to give him a ride, but he said he had his
own driver. “Why shouldn’t I?” He gave me a stern, tight-lipped
nod in response to my look of surprise. “If you don’t want me
to renege on my offer, you must understand that I wrote and I
speak from my essence. I was not and I am still not a good person,
but people like you don’t want to believe that I wasn’t a
sweet-souled mensh before Auschwitz or that I didn’t metamorphose
into a nice <i>boychik</i> after.” He spit out the word “nice”
with such bite that I shivered. Even at his decrepit age, with
his aching, crumbling knees, I thought this man would kill me
for a last piece of bread.
